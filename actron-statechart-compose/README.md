# actron-statechart-compose

Use this when a Machine effect must survive the UI temporarily leaving composition: for
example, an unhandled navigation request or confirmation dialog. Ordinary state rendering
still uses [actron-compose](../actron-compose/README.md); this module handles the Machine's
retained mailbox. Dependency setup follows [installation](../README.md#installation).

Retention is an acknowledgement/retry contract, not an exactly-once guarantee for external
operations. A recreated collector can receive an unacknowledged effect again; handle it
before acknowledging it and choose an application-appropriate retry policy.

Compose Multiplatform helpers for [actron-statechart](../actron-statechart/README.md)'s
`MachineStore`, on top of [actron-compose](../actron-compose): what a screen needs from a machine
that `ViewStore` does not cover. `actron-compose` stays core-only, as upstream keeps it; the
machine's concerns live here.

- **`MailboxEffect(mailbox) { delivery -> … }`**: subscribes the composition to the store's
  retained mailbox (handoff §10). The block runs for each `Delivery`, one at a time, oldest
  first, and acknowledges it once the UI did what the effect asked. What was queued before the
  composition entered is delivered when it enters; what it was handling when it left,
  unacknowledged, waits for the next subscriber, which gets it again with `attempt + 1`, up to
  the policy's budget. One per mailbox at a time, at the screen that owns the store; the block
  handles every kind of effect the policy keeps, with a `when`.

The UI model of a screen is `viewStore.select { it.toUiModel() }` from `actron-compose`: a pure
projection of the snapshot, so nothing of it is here.

Status: **experimental**, `@ExperimentalActronApi`, in the fork [roman-n1/actron](https://github.com/roman-n1/actron).

## Dependency

```kotlin
implementation("io.github.roman-n1:actron-statechart-compose:5.0.0-alpha.1")
```

The module brings `actron-compose` and `actron-statechart` with it (`api` dependencies). Targets:
Android, iOS (arm64, simulator arm64), JVM, JS and Wasm (browser).

## Quick start

```kotlin
@Composable
fun ChatScreen(store: MachineStore<ChatContext, ChatAction, ChatCommand, ChatEffect>, navigator: Navigator) {
    val viewStore = rememberViewStore(store)
    val uiModel = viewStore.select { it.toUiModel() }

    MailboxEffect(store.mailbox) { delivery ->
        when (val effect = delivery.event) {
            is ChatEffect.OpenThread -> navigator.open(effect.threadId)
            is ChatEffect.ConfirmDelete -> if (dialogs.confirm(effect)) viewStore.dispatch(ChatAction.DeleteConfirmed(effect.messageId))
        }
        delivery.acknowledge()                     // the screen took responsibility for it
    }

    ChatContent(uiModel, onSend = { viewStore.dispatch(ChatAction.Send(it)) })
}
```

A block that suspends (a dialog awaiting its answer) is cancelled when the screen leaves, and
the effect returns to the mailbox: the recreated screen shows the dialog again. A block that
throws fails the composition, as a `LaunchedEffect` does; the effect waits for the next
subscriber, and `EffectPolicy.Retained(maxAttempts)` bounds how many screens it may crash.

## Tests

`MailboxEffectTest` runs on every target with a composition on the test dispatcher (a
`Recomposer`, frames sent by hand, no UI): a delivery reaches the block and leaves on
acknowledgement, what was queued before is delivered on entering, a composition leaving
mid-handling hands the effect to the next one as attempt 2, the budget ends the redeliveries, the
latest block is used, a throwing block fails the composition and releases the effect, and a storm
of 200 recreations while 400 effects flow acknowledges each exactly once, the 200 interrupted
ones on their second attempt. `MailboxEffectRaceJvmTest` runs the storm with the store on real
threads.
