/**
 * Carries out the intents of committed [Decision]s: runs commands through the [CommandHandler]
 * under their lane policies, fires timers through the [MachineClock], and feeds what comes back
 * as [MachineInput]s.
 *
 * All bookkeeping lives in one actor coroutine, so it needs no lock: [apply] only enqueues a
 * message and returns, which is what a caller holding the store's lock may do. The bookkeeping
 * of commands is the pure [Lanes]; the actor owns only the jobs, the timers and what a
 * [checkpoint] needs. Commands and timers run as children of [parent] in a scope of their own,
 * cancelled by [close].
