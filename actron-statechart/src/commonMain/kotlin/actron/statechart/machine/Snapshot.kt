/**
 * Everything a [Machine] needs to decide the next step, and everything a checkpoint of the
 * machine itself holds: plain immutable data, so it is a Actron [State] and can be saved,
 * compared and replayed.
 *
 * @property definition The machine this snapshot belongs to
 * @property version The version that produced it; another version must not decide on it
 * @property revision The number of accepted decisions so far: 0 before [MachineInput.Start], then
 * one more per [DecisionOutcome.Handled] decision, also when the business data stayed equal. An
 * ignored or failed input does not advance it
 * @property configuration The active nodes and the history of the chart; empty before start
 * @property context The business data, updated only by reducers and hooks inside a decision
 * @property activations The current activation of every active node
 * @property commands The commands registered and not yet completed, cancelled or failed
 * @property timers The timers scheduled and not yet fired or cancelled
 * @property counters The last ids issued, so the next ids are a function of the snapshot
